#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/TournamentEditor/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/TournamentEditor/db/*.sqlite3
/TournamentEditor/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/TournamentEditor/log/*
/TournamentEditor/tmp/*
!/log/.keep
!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/TournamentEditor/tmp/pids/*
!/tmp/pids/
!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/TournamentEditor/storage/*
!/storage/.keep

/TournamentEditor/public/assets
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
